        <div class="hline">&nbsp;</div>
        <p>
                So far we've seen several different kinds, or
      <dfn>classes</dfn>, of objects:
      strings, integers, floats, arrays, and a few special objects
      (<span class="L2Pcode"><span class="L2Pkeyword">true</span></span>, <span class="L2Pcode"><span class="L2Pkeyword">false</span></span>, and <span class="L2Pcode"><span class="L2Pkeyword">nil</span></span>) which
      we'll talk about later.
      In Ruby, these classes are always capitalized:  <span class="L2Pcode">String</span>,
      <span class="L2Pcode">Integer</span>, <span class="L2Pcode">Float</span>, <span class="L2Pcode">Array</span>... etc.
      In general, if we want to create a new object of a
      certain class, we use <span class="L2Pcode">new</span>:

        </p>
        <pre class="L2PcodeBlock">a = Array.new  + [<span class="L2Pnumber">12345</span>]  <span class="L2Pcomment"># Array  addition.</span>
b = String.new + '<span class="L2Pstring">hello</span>'  <span class="L2Pcomment"># String addition.</span>
c = Time.new

puts '<span class="L2Pstring">a = </span>'+a.to_s
puts '<span class="L2Pstring">b = </span>'+b.to_s
puts '<span class="L2Pstring">c = </span>'+c.to_s</pre>
        <pre class="L2PoutputBlock">a = [12345]
b = hello
c = 2016-01-29 11:35:38 -0800
</pre>
        <p>
                Because we can create arrays and strings using
      <span class="L2Pcode">[...]</span> and <span class="L2Pcode">'<span class="L2Pstring">...</span>'</span> respectively, we rarely create
      them using <span class="L2Pcode">new</span>.  (Though it's not really obvious
      from the above example, <span class="L2Pcode">String.new</span> creates
      an empty string, and <span class="L2Pcode">Array.new</span> creates an empty
      array.)  Also, numbers are special exceptions:  you can't
      create an integer with <span class="L2Pcode">Integer.new</span>.  You just have
      to write the integer.

        </p>
        <h2>
          The <span class="L2Pcode">Time</span> Class
        </h2>
        <p>
                So what's the story with this <span class="L2Pcode">Time</span> class?
      <span class="L2Pcode">Time</span> objects represent moments in time.  You can
      add (or subtract) numbers to (or from) times to get new times:
      adding <span class="L2Pcode"><span class="L2Pnumber">1.5</span></span> to a time makes a new time one-and-a-half
      seconds later:

        </p>
        <pre class="L2PcodeBlock">time  = Time.new   <span class="L2Pcomment"># The moment I generated this web page.</span>
time2 = time + <span class="L2Pnumber">60</span>  <span class="L2Pcomment"># One minute later.</span>

puts time
puts time2</pre>
        <pre class="L2PoutputBlock">2016-01-29 11:35:38 -0800
2016-01-29 11:36:38 -0800
</pre>
        <p>
                You can also make a time for a specific moment using
      <span class="L2Pcode">Time.mktime</span>:

        </p>
        <pre class="L2PcodeBlock">puts Time.mktime(<span class="L2Pnumber">2000</span>, <span class="L2Pnumber">1</span>, <span class="L2Pnumber">1</span>)          <span class="L2Pcomment"># Y2K.</span>
puts Time.mktime(<span class="L2Pnumber">1976</span>, <span class="L2Pnumber">8</span>, <span class="L2Pnumber">3</span>, <span class="L2Pnumber">10</span>, <span class="L2Pnumber">11</span>)  <span class="L2Pcomment"># When I was born.</span></pre>
        <pre class="L2PoutputBlock">2000-01-01 00:00:00 -0800
1976-08-03 10:11:00 -0700
</pre>
        <p>
                Notice:  that's when I was born in Pacific Daylight Savings
      Time (PDT).  When Y2K struck, though, it was Pacific
      Standard Time (PST), at least to us West Coasters.  The
      parentheses are to group the parameters to <span class="L2Pcode">mktime</span>
      together.  The more parameters you add, the more accurate your
      time becomes.

        </p>
        <p>
                You can compare times using the comparison methods
      (an earlier time is <em>less than</em> a later time),
      and if you subtract one time from another, you'll get the
      number of seconds between them.  Play around with it!

        </p>
        <h2>
          A Few Things to Try
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            One billion seconds...  Find out the exact second you
           were born (if you can).  Figure out when you will turn (or
           perhaps when you did turn?) one billion seconds old.  Then
           go mark your calendar.
          </li>
          <li>
            Happy Birthday!  Ask what year a person was born in,
           then the month, then the day.  Figure out how old they are
           and give them a big <span class="L2Poutput">SPANK!</span> for each birthday
           they have had.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>
          The <span class="L2Pcode">Hash</span> Class
        </h2>
        <p>
                Another useful class is the <span class="L2Pcode">Hash</span> class.  Hashes
      are a lot like arrays:  they have a bunch of slots which
      can point to various objects.  However, in an array, the
      slots are lined up in a row, and each one is numbered
      (starting from zero).  In a hash, the slots aren't in
      a row (they are just sort of jumbled together), and you
      can use <em>any</em> object to refer to a slot, not just
      a number.  It's good to use hashes when you have a bunch
      of things you want to keep track of, but they don't really
      fit into an ordered list.  For example, the colors I use for different
      parts of the code which created this tutorial:

        </p>
        <pre class="L2PcodeBlock">colorArray = []  <span class="L2Pcomment"># same as Array.new</span>
colorHash  = {}  <span class="L2Pcomment"># same as Hash.new</span>

colorArray[<span class="L2Pnumber">0</span>]         = '<span class="L2Pstring">red</span>'
colorArray[<span class="L2Pnumber">1</span>]         = '<span class="L2Pstring">green</span>'
colorArray[<span class="L2Pnumber">2</span>]         = '<span class="L2Pstring">blue</span>'
colorHash['<span class="L2Pstring">strings</span>']  = '<span class="L2Pstring">red</span>'
colorHash['<span class="L2Pstring">numbers</span>']  = '<span class="L2Pstring">green</span>'
colorHash['<span class="L2Pstring">keywords</span>'] = '<span class="L2Pstring">blue</span>'

colorArray.each <span class="L2Pkeyword">do</span> |color|
  puts color
<span class="L2Pkeyword">end</span>
colorHash.each <span class="L2Pkeyword">do</span> |codeType, color|
  puts codeType + '<span class="L2Pstring">:  </span>' + color
<span class="L2Pkeyword">end</span></pre>
        <pre class="L2PoutputBlock">red
green
blue
strings:  red
numbers:  green
keywords:  blue
</pre>
        <p>
                If I use an array, I have to remember that slot <span class="L2Pcode"><span class="L2Pnumber">0</span></span> is for
      strings, slot <span class="L2Pcode"><span class="L2Pnumber">1</span></span> is for numbers, etc.  But if I use a hash, it's
      easy!  Slot <span class="L2Pcode">'<span class="L2Pstring">strings</span>'</span> holds the color of the strings, of course.
      Nothing to remember.  You might have noticed that when we used
      <span class="L2Pcode">each</span>, the objects in the hash didn't come out in the same
      order we put them in.  Arrays
      are for keeping things in order, not hashes.

        </p>
        <p>
                Though people usually use strings to name the slots in a hash, you
      could use any kind of object, even arrays and other hashes (though I can't
      think of why you would want to do this...):

        </p>
        <pre class="L2PcodeBlock">weirdHash = Hash.new

weirdHash[<span class="L2Pnumber">12</span>] = '<span class="L2Pstring">monkeys</span>'
weirdHash[[]] = '<span class="L2Pstring">emptiness</span>'
weirdHash[Time.new] = '<span class="L2Pstring">no time like the present</span>'</pre>
        <p>
                Hashes and arrays are good for different things; it's up
      to you to decide which one is best for a particular problem.

        </p>
        <h2>
          Extending Classes
        </h2>
        <p>
                At the end of the last chapter, you wrote a method to give
      the English phrase for a given integer.  It wasn't an integer
      method, though; it was just a generic "program" method.  Wouldn't
      it be nice if you could write something like <span class="L2Pcode"><span class="L2Pnumber">22</span>.to_eng</span>
      instead of <span class="L2Pcode">englishNumber&nbsp;<span class="L2Pnumber">22</span></span>?  Here's how you would do
      that:

        </p>
        <pre class="L2PcodeBlock"><span class="L2Pkeyword">class</span> <span class="L2Pdefinition">Integer</span>
  <span class="L2Pkeyword">def</span> <span class="L2Pdefinition">to_eng</span>
    <span class="L2Pkeyword">if</span> <span class="L2Pkeyword">self</span> == <span class="L2Pnumber">5</span>
      english = '<span class="L2Pstring">five</span>'
    <span class="L2Pkeyword">else</span>
      english = '<span class="L2Pstring">fifty-eight</span>'
    <span class="L2Pkeyword">end</span>

    english
  <span class="L2Pkeyword">end</span>
<span class="L2Pkeyword">end</span>

<span class="L2Pcomment"># I'd better test on a couple of numbers...</span>
puts <span class="L2Pnumber">5</span>.to_eng
puts <span class="L2Pnumber">58</span>.to_eng</pre>
        <pre class="L2PoutputBlock">five
fifty-eight
</pre>
        <p>
                Well, I tested it; it seems to work.  ;)

        </p>
        <p>
                So we defined an integer method by jumping into the
      <span class="L2Pcode">Integer</span> class, defining the method there,
      and jumping back out.  Now all integers have this
      (somewhat incomplete) method.  In fact, if you didn't
      like the way a built-in method like
      <span class="L2Pcode">to_s</span> worked, you could just
      redefine it in much the same way... but I don't recommend
      it!  It's best to leave the old methods alone and to
      make new ones when you want to do something new.

        </p>
        <p>
                So... confused yet?  Let me go over that last program
      some more.  So far, whenever we executed any code or
      defined any methods, we did it in the default
      "program" object.  In our last program, we left that
      object for the first time and went into the class
      <span class="L2Pcode">Integer</span>.  We defined a method there (which
      makes it an integer method) and all integers can
      use it.  Inside that method we use <span class="L2Pcode"><span class="L2Pkeyword">self</span></span>
      to refer to the object (the integer) using the method.

        </p>
        <h2>
          Creating Classes
        </h2>
        <p>
                We've seen a number of different classes of objects.
      However, it's easy to come up with kinds of objects
      that Ruby doesn't have.  Luckily, creating a new
      class is as easy as extending an old one.  Let's say
      we wanted to make some dice in Ruby.  Here's how we
      could make the Die class:

        </p>
        <pre class="L2PcodeBlock"><span class="L2Pkeyword">class</span> <span class="L2Pdefinition">Die</span>

  <span class="L2Pkeyword">def</span> <span class="L2Pdefinition">roll</span>
    <span class="L2Pnumber">1</span> + rand(<span class="L2Pnumber">6</span>)
  <span class="L2Pkeyword">end</span>

<span class="L2Pkeyword">end</span>

<span class="L2Pcomment"># Let's make a couple of dice...</span>
dice = [Die.new, Die.new]

<span class="L2Pcomment"># ...and roll them.</span>
dice.each <span class="L2Pkeyword">do</span> |die|
  puts die.roll
<span class="L2Pkeyword">end</span></pre>
        <pre class="L2PoutputBlock">6
2
</pre>
        <p>
                (If you skipped the section on random numbers,
      <span class="L2Pcode">rand(<span class="L2Pnumber">6</span>)</span> just gives a random number between
      <span class="L2Pcode"><span class="L2Pnumber">0</span></span> and <span class="L2Pcode"><span class="L2Pnumber">5</span></span>.)

        </p>
        <p>
                And that's it!  Objects of our very own.

        </p>
        <p>
                We can define
      all sorts of methods for our objects... but there's
      something missing.  Working with these objects feels
      a lot like programming before we learned about
      variables.  Look at our dice, for example.  We can
      roll them, and each time we do they give us a different
      number.  But if we wanted to hang on to that number, we
      would have to create a variable to point to the number.
      It seems like any decent die should be able to <em>have</em>
      a number, and that rolling the die should change the number.
      If we keep track of the die, we shouldn't also have to keep track
      of the number it is showing.

        </p>
        <p>
                However, if we try to store the number we rolled in a (local)
      variable in <span class="L2Pcode">roll</span>, it will be gone as soon as
      <span class="L2Pcode">roll</span> is finished.  We need to store the number in
      a different kind of variable:

        </p>
        <h2>
          Instance Variables
        </h2>
        <p>
                Normally when we want to talk about a string, we will just
      call it a <dfn>string</dfn>.  However, we could also call
      it a <dfn>string object</dfn>.  Sometimes programmers might
      call it <dfn>an instance of the class <span class="L2Pcode">String</span></dfn>, but this
      is just a fancy (and rather long-winded) way of saying
      <dfn>string</dfn>.  An <dfn>instance</dfn> of a class is just an
      object of that class.

        </p>
        <p>
                So instance variables are just an object's variables.  A
      method's local variables last until the method is finished.
      An object's instance variables, on the other hand, will
      last as long as the object does.  To tell instance variables
      from local variables, they have <span class="L2Pcode">@</span> in front of
      their names:

        </p>
        <pre class="L2PcodeBlock"><span class="L2Pkeyword">class</span> <span class="L2Pdefinition">Die</span>

  <span class="L2Pkeyword">def</span> <span class="L2Pdefinition">roll</span>
    @numberShowing = <span class="L2Pnumber">1</span> + rand(<span class="L2Pnumber">6</span>)
  <span class="L2Pkeyword">end</span>

  <span class="L2Pkeyword">def</span> <span class="L2Pdefinition">showing</span>
    @numberShowing
  <span class="L2Pkeyword">end</span>

<span class="L2Pkeyword">end</span>

die = Die.new
die.roll
puts die.showing
puts die.showing
die.roll
puts die.showing
puts die.showing</pre>
        <pre class="L2PoutputBlock">4
4
6
6
</pre>
        <p>
                Very nice!  So <span class="L2Pcode">roll</span> rolls the die and
      <span class="L2Pcode">showing</span> tells us which number is showing.
      However, what if we try to look at what's showing before
      we've rolled the die (before we've set <span class="L2Pcode">@numberShowing</span>)?

        </p>
        <pre class="L2PcodeBlock"><span class="L2Pkeyword">class</span> <span class="L2Pdefinition">Die</span>

  <span class="L2Pkeyword">def</span> <span class="L2Pdefinition">roll</span>
    @numberShowing = <span class="L2Pnumber">1</span> + rand(<span class="L2Pnumber">6</span>)
  <span class="L2Pkeyword">end</span>

  <span class="L2Pkeyword">def</span> <span class="L2Pdefinition">showing</span>
    @numberShowing
  <span class="L2Pkeyword">end</span>

<span class="L2Pkeyword">end</span>

<span class="L2Pcomment"># Since I'm not going to use this die again,</span>
<span class="L2Pcomment"># I don't need to save it in a variable.</span>
puts Die.new.showing</pre>
        <pre class="L2PoutputBlock">
</pre>
        <p>
                Hmmm... well, at least it didn't give us an error.  Still,
      it doesn't really make sense for a die to be "unrolled", or
      whatever <span class="L2Poutput">nil</span> is supposed to mean here.  It would
      be nice if we could set up our new die object right when it's
      created.  That's what <span class="L2Pcode">initialize</span> is for:

        </p>
        <pre class="L2PcodeBlock"><span class="L2Pkeyword">class</span> <span class="L2Pdefinition">Die</span>

  <span class="L2Pkeyword">def</span> <span class="L2Pdefinition">initialize</span>
    <span class="L2Pcomment"># I'll just roll the die, though we</span>
    <span class="L2Pcomment"># could do something else if we wanted</span>
    <span class="L2Pcomment"># to, like setting the die with 6 showing.</span>
    roll
  <span class="L2Pkeyword">end</span>

  <span class="L2Pkeyword">def</span> <span class="L2Pdefinition">roll</span>
    @numberShowing = <span class="L2Pnumber">1</span> + rand(<span class="L2Pnumber">6</span>)

  <span class="L2Pkeyword">def</span> <span class="L2Pdefinition">showing</span>
    @numberShowing
  <span class="L2Pkeyword">end</span>

<span class="L2Pkeyword">end</span>

puts Die.new.showing</pre>
        <pre class="L2PoutputBlock">1
</pre>
        <p>
                When an object is created, its <span class="L2Pcode">initialize</span>
      method (if it has one defined) is always called.

        </p>
        <p>
                Our dice are just about perfect.  The only thing that
      might be missing is a way to set which side of a die
      is showing... why don't you write a <span class="L2Pcode">cheat</span>
      method which does just that!  Come back when you're
      done (and when you tested that it worked, of course).
      Make sure that someone can't set the die to have a
      <span class="L2Pcode"><span class="L2Pnumber">7</span></span> showing!

        </p>
        <p>
                So that's some pretty cool stuff we just covered.  It's tricky,
      though, so let me give another, more interesting example.
      Let's say we want to make a simple virtual pet, a baby
      dragon.  Like most babies, it should be able to eat, sleep,
      and poop, which means we will need to be able to feed it,
      put it to bed, and take it on walks.  Internally, our dragon
      will need to keep track of if it is hungry, tired, or needs
      to go, but we won't be able to see that when we interact
      with our dragon, just like you can't ask a human baby,
      "Are you hungry?".  We'll also add a few other fun ways
      we can interact with our baby dragon, and when he is born
      we'll give him a name.  (Whatever you pass into the
      <span class="L2Pcode">new</span> method is passed into the <span class="L2Pcode">initialize</span>
      method for you.)  Alright, let's give it a shot:

        </p>

        <p>
                <em>Whew!</em>  Of course, it would be nicer if this was
      an interactive program, but you can do that part later.
      I was just trying to show the parts directly relating to
      creating a new dragon class.

        </p>
        <p>
                We saw a few new things in that example.  The first is
      simple:  <span class="L2Pcode">exit</span> terminates the program right
      then and there.  The second is the word <span class="L2Pcode">private</span>
      which we stuck right in the middle of our class definition.
      I could have left it out, but I wanted to enforce the idea
      of certain methods being things you can do to a dragon, and
      others which simply happen within the dragon.  You can think
      of these as being "under the hood":  unless you are an
      automobile mechanic, all you really need to know is the gas
      pedal, the brake pedal, and the steering wheel.  A programmer
      might call those the <dfn>public interface</dfn> to your car.
      How your airbag knows when to deploy, however, is internal to
      the car; the typical user (driver) doesn't need to know about
      this.

        </p>
        <p>
                Actually, for a bit more concrete example along those lines,
      let's talk about how you might represent a car in a video
      game (which happens to be my line of work).  First, you would
      want to decide what you want your public interface to look like;
      in other words, which methods should people be able to call on
      one of your car objects?  Well, they need to be able to push
      the gas pedal and the brake pedal, but they would also need to
      be able to specify how hard they are pushing the pedal.  (There's
      a big difference between flooring it and tapping it.)  They would
      also need to be able to steer, and again, they would need to be
      able to say how hard they are turning the wheel.  I suppose you
      could go further and add a clutch, turn signals, rocket launcher,
      afterburner, flux capacitor, etc... it depends
      on what type of game you are making.

        </p>
        <p>
                Internal to a car object, though, there would need to be much
      more going on; other things a car would need are a speed,
      a direction, and a position (at the most basic).  These attributes
      would be modified by pressing on the gas or brake pedals and
      turning the wheel, of course, but the user would not be able
      to set the position directly (which would be like warping).
      You might also want to keep track of skidding or damage, if
      you have caught any air, and so on.  These would all be internal
      to your car object.

        </p>
        <h2>
          A Few Things to Try
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Make an <span class="L2Pcode">OrangeTree</span> class.  It should have a
           <span class="L2Pcode">height</span> method which returns its height, and a
           <span class="L2Pcode">oneYearPasses</span> method, which, when called, ages the tree
           one year.  Each year the tree grows taller (however much you think
           an orange tree should grow in a year), and after some number of
           years (again, your call) the tree should die.  For the first few
           years, it should not produce fruit, but after a while it should,
           and I guess that older trees produce more each year than younger
           trees... whatever you think makes most sense.  And, of course,
           you should be able to <span class="L2Pcode">countTheOranges</span> (which returns
           the number of oranges on the tree), and <span class="L2Pcode">pickAnOrange</span>
           (which reduces the <span class="L2Pcode">@orangeCount</span> by one and returns a
           string telling you how delicious the orange was, or else it just
           tells you that there are no more oranges to pick this year).
           Make sure that any oranges you don't pick one year fall off
           before the next year.
          </li>
          <li>
            Write a program so that you can interact with your
           baby dragon.  You should be able to enter commands like
           <span class="L2Pinput">feed</span> and <span class="L2Pinput">walk</span>, and have those methods
           be called on your dragon.  Of course, since what you are
           inputting are just strings, you will have to have some sort
           of <dfn>method dispatch</dfn>, where your program checks
           which string was entered, and then calls the appropriate method.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
                And that's just about all there is to it!  But wait a second...
      I haven't told you about any of those classes for doing things
      like sending an email, or saving and loading files on your
      computer, or how to create windows and buttons, or 3D worlds,
      or anything!  Well, there are just <em>so many</em> classes
      you can use that I can't possibly show you them all; I don't
      even know what most of them are!  What I <em>can</em> tell
      you is where to find out more about them, so you can learn
      about the ones you want to program with.  Before I send you
      off, though, there is just one more feature of Ruby you should
      know about, something most languages don't have, but which I
      simply could not live without:
